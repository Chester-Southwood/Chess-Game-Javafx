# Chess-Game-Javafx

**Description:** A simple Chess Game Application made using JavaFX. The start of the project is based on Alamas Balmagambetov's [JavaFX Game Checkers](https://youtu.be/6S6km5duBrM) youtube video walkthrough. There is no affiliation, but I recommend going to his channel to learn the basics of JavaFX for game development for any who are interested.

**TODOs:**

* [ ] Create Et Passa move for Pawn pieces.

 * [ ] Create Check "Checking" throughout the game for when king is in "Check" or would be in "Check".
   	* [ ] After doing the related TODO, create "Checkmate" logic for endgame.
	* [ ] Change checkers icons to chess piece icons, there is already a comment that contains the code to do so after finding the piece image icons to use.
	* [ ] Have some way to notify on board who's turn it is, such as text on top of board displaying the current player's turn.

**Known Glitches:**

* There are cases of pieces that are captured but have not been deleted after being captured.
  * A related bug is some pawns not able to capture enemy pieces that have captured one of your pieces.
